# sematic-nav

A HTML5 compliant nav bar solution

I've used just about every nav bar out there, from Bootstrap to Foundation to
Semantic UI and so on, and every single one of them doesn't use any HTML5
elements. Instead, they opt for a whole bunch of **`<div>` soup** which I cannot
stand. Also, a lot of developers will include these huge frameworks just to use
the nav bar and nothing else. So, I made this.

In the `/dist` directory, you will find the CSS, HTML, JavaScript to make it
work. I have also included the SCSS I used to make it and an **AngularJS**
directive you can use for it.

**Enjoy**
