# sematic-nav

A HTML5 compliant nav bar solution

I've used just about every nav bar out there, from Bootstrap to Foundation to Semantic UI and so on. I grew tired of the lack of semantic HTML5 element usage and the mangled **`<div>` soup** that they come with which I cannot
stand. They also require you to attach a whole host of classes to the nested div jungle they ask you to plop into your page that makes it extremely frustrating to switch one css file out for another one. They also require you to use jQuery or Zepto or whatever other JavaScript library along with their own 100+KB JavaScript file to power the darn thing.

So, I made **semantic-nav**.

The whole point behind this is to use semantic HTML5 elements, concise CSS, and vanilla JS to make a responsive navigation/nav-bar solution.

No, this will not work if you want to put 50 links and 10 dropdowns with nested dropdowns within nested dropdowns into your nav bar. If you're doing that, you need to read a book about usability and not another framework.

In the `/dist` directory, you will find the CSS, HTML, JavaScript to make it work. I have also included the SCSS I used to make it and an **AngularJS** directive you can use if that's your cup of tea.

**Enjoy**
